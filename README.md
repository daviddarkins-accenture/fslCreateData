# fslCreateData

This app will create 20 Accounts for Pizza resturants/locations within the New York area.

Pressing the create button will start a Flow which will create the following

* 1 Work Order per Account (where the name contains FSL)
* 3 Work Order Line Items are assigned to the Work Order
* Work Types are set to each Work Order Line Item
* 1 Service Appointment is assigned to the Work Order
* All variables can be configured within the Flow
* The Flow will also make the same data for all the Accounts for Today+1 and Today+2
* After pressing create you will have 60 Work Orders (each with 3 WOLI and 1 Service Appointment) - 20 Work Orders are created for today, 20 for Today+1 and 20 for Today+2
